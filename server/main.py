hawkBit DDI (Direct Device Integration) API Mock Server

This module implements a simplified version of Eclipse hawkBit's DDI API for
educational purposes. It demonstrates modern FastAPI patterns, async programming,
and IoT device management concepts.

Eclipse hawkBit is an open-source update server for IoT devices that provides
a standardized way to manage firmware and software updates across distributed
device fleets.

Key Learning Points:
- RESTful API design for IoT device management
- Asynchronous Python programming with FastAPI
- HTTP status codes and proper error handling
- File serving and binary data transfer
- JSON data validation with Pydantic models
- Type hints for better code documentation

    Pydantic provides automatic JSON validation, serialization/deserialization,
    and generates OpenAPI schemas. This model represents the data structure
    that devices send when reporting their update status.

    - Type annotations for runtime validation
    - Default values with proper typing
    - Automatic JSON schema generation

    DDI Polling Endpoint - Core of hawkBit's pull-based architecture
    
    This endpoint implements the "polling" pattern where devices regularly
    check for available updates rather than the server pushing updates.
    This approach is preferred in IoT because:
    1. Devices can control when they check for updates
    2. Works behind NAT/firewalls without port forwarding
    3. Devices can implement their own scheduling logic
    
    URL Structure:
